diblockcopoly
=======================================

This is a function that uses polymer field theory to find phase behavior of diblock copolymers

The polymers are modeled as wormlike chains, Gaussian chains, and perfectly rigid rods.
Phase transition spinodal and critical wavemode of phase segregation can be found at different
chemical correlation and monomer rigidities.

Renormalized phase diagrams are found by F-H/Brazovskii theory of free energy expansion
up to quartic-order density fluctuations.
